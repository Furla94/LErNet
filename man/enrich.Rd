\item{mart}{a biomaRt object of the given species need for the conversion from  Ensembl to Entrez IDs}

\item{oganism}{oganism name (see \code{\link[ReactomePA]{enrichPathway}})}
}
\value{
a ReactomePA result object.
}
\description{
Computes functional enrichment of a given set of proteins via the ReactomePA package.
A bar plot reporting the enriched pathway and their p-values is shown.
